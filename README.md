# Project Overview
In this project, I implemented a Pointer-Generator Network to tackle the challenge of summarizing long documents in a more efficient and human-like way. I focused on improving the modelâ€™s ability to capture key information while avoiding repetition.

I started by building a basic sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model, which is commonly used for tasks like text generation. Then, I introduced the pointer mechanism, allowing the model to decide when to generate new words or copy directly from the original text. This made the summaries more accurate, especially when handling specific names or numbers.

To make the summaries more readable and less repetitive, I added a coverage mechanism. This feature ensures the model keeps track of which parts of the source text have already been summarized, reducing the chance of saying the same thing twice.

Throughout the project, I tested the model on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset, which contains news articles and their summaries. I also experimented with different model settings and compared the performance of the Pointer-Generator Network with coverage mechanism and sequence-to-sequence model, favoring Pointer-Generator due to its superior Rouge F1 score. The results showed a clear improvement, making this approach highly effective for text summarization.
